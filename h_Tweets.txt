@iamfariha @SRKUniverse @iamsrk Beautifully written Fariha! I think every hard core #SRKian feels the same. Just that not everyone can put them to words so appropriately. You have made that difficult task so easy by this apt explaination of what Shah Rukh means to us all! 🥰🥰
Thank you for the awesome 27 years everybody and Thank you Sharad for the bikes! https://t.co/UMg6k78C06
While SRK’s in a low phase, he’ll spring back. He had a low phase in 1999-2003 &amp; critics thought he was over. We all know how that went 😏😉. Wish u many more yrs of success Shahrukh. Forever my Baadshah! 💕 Love u @iamsrk #27YearsOfKingOfBollywood
