@Debbie56111656 @AmericaRising @JoeBiden @cthagod @breakfastclubam Man won many awards from the NAACP until he ran as a REPUBLICAN candidate. Had he been a democrat candidate, he would magically not have been a racist

The way Democrats assume/demand loyalty from black voters while doing little to nothing to help the community is the most racist shit ive ever seen. https://t.co/mkVvOkj4Eu

Yet, the media will call Trump a racist 500 times today and refer to Biden as MLK.
