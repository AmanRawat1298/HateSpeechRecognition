1. "A study of 96,000 hospitalized coronavirus patients on six continents found that those who received an antimalarial drug promoted by President Trump as a 'game changer' in the fight against the virus had a significantly higher risk of death compared with those who did not."
@CNN It took @SpeakerPelosi and @chuckschumer to shame Trump into this acknowledgment. Meanwhile, a BIG jump in new cases in Texas and Florida. At this rate, we are 100,000 my Memorial Day. Trump's incompetence kills.

@RaginGayjun @StreetsAheadWV @BillMo617 @kkondik Do you really think Sanders would give any concessions to the less progressive wings of the party? I would have voted for him if he was the nominee either way because Trump is worse. I wouldn‚Äôt have whined like a toddler about being taken for granted.

1.3 million black Americans already voted for Trump in 2016. This morning, Joe Biden told every single one of us we ‚Äúain‚Äôt black.‚Äù I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm surprised, but it‚Äôs sadly par for the course for Democrats to take the black community for granted and brow beat those that don‚Äôt agree.

Our associate challenged his friends on Facebook to recite one thing Trump has ever said that was intelligent, relevant, and true - had to be all 3. Astounding how few answers there were. This stood out: "If you let everyone vote, the Republicans will never win another election."
@GOPLeader Did you know @realDonaldTrump waited 42 days (6 weeks), until March 14 to block entry into the US from Europe? By then the #Coronavirus had spread worldwide with many people entering the US freely. Most entered through NY. Trump failed to keep us safe.

"If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't Black." - Joe Biden

Joe thinks if you‚Äôre Black, the Democratic Party owns your vote. If you‚Äôre Black and don‚Äôt want to vote for Joe... He says you aren‚Äôt Black. Racist! https://t.co/br8Z06Ncqr
Beating Trump in November is not the goal.  It is not even the minimum acceptable outcome.  The GOP is the problem.  The GOP must be defeated in both the Senate and the House.  The GOP must be defeated up and down the ballot.  Don't lose sight of this.  Work for it daily.
Trump and Republican governors claim that reopening the economy is about the freedom of the American people. Baloney.

It's about the freedom of billionaires and corporations to profit during a public health crisis by forcing millions of people to go back to work.
